-- Create upload directories for file storage
-- This is a placeholder migration - directories need to be created manually

-- Note: This migration file serves as documentation
-- The following directories need to be created on the server:
-- ./uploads/careers/
-- ./uploads/publications/
-- ./uploads/documents/
-- ./uploads/images/

-- These directories are already handled by the Go backend when files are uploaded
-- No SQL commands needed for directory creation
