Summary

CPT codes are owned by the AMA (American Medical Association) — they are copyrighted intellectual property.

You cannot legally copy, store, or distribute CPT codes (even if you find them online) without a license.

If you do, you could face copyright infringement or legal penalties from the AMA.

Optum (and a few other companies) are authorized resellers or data partners.

You can legally use CPT codes in your system if you license them through Optum or directly from the AMA.

Optum also offers extra tools (like ICD-10 codes, APIs, and regular updates).

⚖️ Bottom Line

❌ No, you can’t just copy or scrape CPT codes from the internet.
✅ Yes, you must get a license — either from the AMA or through a provider like Optum — before using them in your EHR system.
